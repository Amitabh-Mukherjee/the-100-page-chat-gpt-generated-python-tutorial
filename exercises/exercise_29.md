# Exercise 29
Define a function that can accept two strings as input and concatenate them and then print it in console.

## Code
```python
sum = lambda s1, s2: s1 + s2
print(sum("10", "45"))  # 1045
```

## ChatGPT Explanation

This code defines a lambda function named sum that takes in two arguments, `s1` and `s2`, and returns their concatenation as a string. Then it calls this lambda function with the arguments "10" and "45" and prints the result, which is "1045".
