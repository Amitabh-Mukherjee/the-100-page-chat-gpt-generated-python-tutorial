# Exercise 20
Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

## Code
```python
class MyGen:
    def by_seven(self, n):
        for i in range(0, int(n / 7) + 1):
            yield i * 7


for i in MyGen().by_seven(int(input("Please enter a number... "))):
    print(i)
```


## ChatGPT Explanation

This code defines a class called `MyGen` that has a method called `by_seven`. The method takes in a number `n` as an argument and uses a `for` loop to iterate over a range of numbers that are multiples of 7 and less than or equal to `n`. The method uses the yield keyword to return each multiple of 7 one at a time as the `for` loop iterates through the range.

After the class is defined, the code prompts the user to enter a number, and then it creates an instance of the `MyGen` class and calls the `by_seven` method with the user-provided number as an argument. The code then uses a `for` loop to print out each number generated by the `by_seven` method one at a time.
