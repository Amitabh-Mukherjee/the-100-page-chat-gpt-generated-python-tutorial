# Exercise 68
Please generate a random float where the value is between 10 and 100 using Python module.

## Code
```python
import random

rand_num = random.uniform(10, 100)
print(rand_num)
```

## ChatGPT Explanation
The code is generating a random floating-point number between 10 and 100 using the `uniform` function from the `random` module in Python. The `uniform` function generates a random float value between two given parameters (inclusive). In this case, it's generating a random float value between 10 and 100.
