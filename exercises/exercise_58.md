# Exercise 58
Write a special comment to indicate a Python source code file is in unicode.

## Code
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```

## ChatGPT Explanation
The line `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*- `is a special comment line in the Python code that indicates the encoding of the source code file. In this case, the source code is encoded using UTF-8, which is a widely used character encoding that can handle a large number of characters from various scripts and languages.

This line is usually placed at the beginning of the file to specify the encoding of the file, which helps the Python interpreter understand and process the file correctly.
