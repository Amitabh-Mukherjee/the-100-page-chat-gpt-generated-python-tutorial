# Exercise 66
Please write a program which accepts basic mathematic expression from console and print the evaluation result.

## Code
```python
expression = input()
ans = eval(expression)
print(ans)
```

## ChatGPT Explanation
The code reads an expression as input from the user and then evaluates it using the `eval` function in Python. The result of the evaluation is then printed to the console.

For example, if the user inputs `2 + 3`, the code will evaluate `2 + 3` to `5` and then print `5` to the console.
