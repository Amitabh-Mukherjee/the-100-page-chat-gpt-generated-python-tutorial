# Exercise 26

Define a function which can compute the sum of two numbers.

## Code
```python
sum = lambda n1, n2: n1 + n2  # here lambda is use to define little function as sum
print(sum(1, 2))
```

## ChatGPT Explanation

This code creates an anonymous function called `sum` that takes in two parameters, `n1` and `n2`, and returns their sum. The function is then immediately called with the arguments 1 and 2, and the result of that function call (3) is printed.
