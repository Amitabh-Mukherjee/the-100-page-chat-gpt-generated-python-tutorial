# Exercise 75
Please write a program to randomly print a integer number between 7 and 15 inclusive.

## Code
```python
import random
print(random.randrange(7, 16))

```

## ChatGPT Explanation

The following code snippet is written in Python and it uses the `random` module.

The `random.randrange(start, stop)` method is used to generate a random number within a range, in this case between 7 and 16 (excluding 16).

The result of the `random.randrange(7, 16)` method is then printed to the console. This means that each time the code is run, a different random number between 7 and 16 will be generated and printed to the console.
