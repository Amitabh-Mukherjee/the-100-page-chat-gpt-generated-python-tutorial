# Exercise 57
Write a program to read an ASCII string and to convert it to a unicode string encoded by utf-8.

## Code
```python
s = input()
u = s.encode("utf-8")
print(u)

```

## ChatGPT Explanation

The code first takes input from the user and stores it in the variable `s`. Then it uses the `encode` method of the `str` class to encode the string `s` into `utf-8`format and stores the result in a variable `u`. Finally, it prints the encoded string `u`.

The `encode` method is used to convert the string into a specific encoding format, in this case, `utf-8`. The `utf-8` format is a widely used character encoding that can handle a wide range of characters from different languages and scripts.

By converting the string into `utf-8`, it can be transmitted over the internet and stored in various data storage systems in a consistent manner, ensuring that the characters are properly displayed on different platforms.
